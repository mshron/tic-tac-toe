* Set up git repo
* Generate all possible game states
   * Change id from order of moves to 
   * Check to see if a state is a win/loss/tie, if so record accordingly for that node, add to a set of end state nodes, and continue
   * Otherwise:
     * Compare the id against the set 0..8, and generating one new move for each in that resulting difference
     * Populate queue of (set?) of new ids as they get made
     * Pop off the queue and continue from there
* For each end state node, go back up the tree to the previous nodes and mark them as ancestors of a win/loss/tie
* Prune the tree so we only chose descendants which lead to a victory (if possible) or a tie (if not)
* Make an html file or anchor tag for each real node in the tree, with an interface

Maybe
* Rotational symmetry?
