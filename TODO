* Why aren't all the win/loss counts symmetric?
* For each end state node, go back up the tree to the previous nodes and mark them as ancestors of a win/loss/tie
* Prune the tree so we only chose descendants which lead to a victory (if possible) or a tie (if not)
* Make an html file or anchor tag for each real node in the tree, with an interface

Maybe
* Rotational symmetry?
